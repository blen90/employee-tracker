## My task

My task for this homework was to create an Employee Tracker to manage a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

We have three different tables one for department, one for role and one for employee information. 

The department table has an id and the name of the department.

The role table has and id, title of the employee (role), salary and the department id.

The employee table has the first and last names of the employee, role id and the manager id.
